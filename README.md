Howdy! You've just forked AstroBlend, a visualization tool for scientific datasets.  This uses the Blender python library to make it do things that, frankly, it was not entirely designed for.  Hacktacular!

Full documentation and tutorials can be found at:

www.astroblend.com

Note that you'll have to point your Blender scripts to the science library for now.  See the first 2 tutorials for examples.  Other then that, you are good to go!
